# File patterns to exclude from analysis
# One pattern per line, supports glob patterns and **/folder/** syntax
# Lines starting with # are comments
#
# Note: The following are ALWAYS ignored by default in code:
# - All dot-directories (.git, .venv, .cache, .pytest_cache, etc.)
# - Common build dirs: build, dist, target, out, output, outputs
# - Cache dirs: __pycache__, node_modules, .mypy_cache, .ruff_cache
# - Temp dirs: tmp, temp, .tmp, .temp
# - Log dirs: logs
# - Common file patterns: *.pyc, *.pyo, *.log, *.swp, .DS_Store

# Project-specific patterns (add your custom patterns here)
# Examples:
# data/
# *.db
# docs/internal/

# Config files to exclude
.locusignore
.locusallow
.claudeignore
.claudeallow
